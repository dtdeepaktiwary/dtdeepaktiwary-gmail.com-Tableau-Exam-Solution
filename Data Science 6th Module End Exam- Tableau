Q. Explain in detail the area graphs and line graphs in tableau and how to create them with examples. (With the help of an example create one in tableau)
Ans- An area chart is a line chart where the area between the line and the axis are shaded with a color. These charts are typically used to represent accumulated totals over time and are the conventional way to display stacked lines.
      Line charts connect individual data points in a view. They provide a simple way to visualize a sequence of values and are useful when you want to see trends over time, or to forecast future values. 
     To create a view that displays the sum of sales and the sum of profit for all years, and then uses forecasting to determine a trend, follow these steps:
Connect to the Sample - Superstore data source.
Drag the Order Date dimension to Columns.
Tableau aggregates the date by year, and creates column headers.
Drag the Sales measure to Rows.
Tableau aggregates Sales as SUM and displays a simple line chart.
Drag the Profit measure to Rows and drop it to the right of the Sales measure.
Tableau creates separate axes along the left margin for Sales and Profit.
